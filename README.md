## No Cofidence: A Quick Look at Pfizer's Phase 3 Covid Vaccine Trial for Children

<p>
Herein is a review of some of the publicly available official documents regarding Pfizer’s Covid vaccine development.

Since the start of the Covid outbreak, the race for testing new platforms designed to confer immunity against it, has been rampant and unprecedented. Under conditional emergency authorization, the current mandate is to immunize the world population as quickly as possible. The lack of thorough testing in animals prior to clinical trials, and authorization based on safety data generated during trials that lasted less than 3-1/2 months, raises questions regarding vaccine safety.

<i>Spoiler alert:</i> 

The Covid vaccines were approved for emergency use based on both minimal and inadequate studies to evaluate their safety and effectiveness when compared with the standard <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fparents%2Finfographics%2Fjourney-of-child-vaccine-text.html">vaccine approval process</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

Significant evidence of questionable practices, deficiencies and omissions will be highlighted. The omissions of standard safety precautions and glaring scientific dishonesty are so obvious, they cannot be attributed to the incompetence of the manufacturer or regulators. Everything uncovered here is clearly visible to the untrained eye, but was never questioned by regulators, health authorities or the media. 

The cursory nature of the development and authorization program at times can be summarized as, “no safety signals were found because we didn’t look for them."<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Given the high rate of occurrence of reported adverse effects, as well as the potential for vaccine-driven disease enhancement, autoimmunity, and immune evasion, there is a need for a better understanding of the benefits and risks of mass vaccination, particularly in groups excluded from the brief clinical trials. Despite calls for caution, risk minimization has been ignored by health organizations, government authorities and any critical information regarding the vaccinations has been censored by the media. 

We should be enacting risk mitigation and calling for a pause in mass vaccination. If a disinterested non-associated party authorized and empowered to monitor the vaccine process does not exist, then vaccination should be halted immediately, in particular for demographic groups at highest risk of vaccine-associated death or serious adverse effects. The “do something, do anything” mindset adopted early in the pandemic must be constrained as the cure is becoming worse than the disease.
  
Evidenced based medicine has died.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I’m sorry to state it, but if you read this, you’ll will never trust the pharmaceutical industry again.

By contrast, Pfizer had a total of roughly 40,000 individuals in it's trial.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"></a></p></li>

<li id="fn3"><p> Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become a politically and corporate manipulated failure. EBM as an interdisciplinary approach employing techniques from science, engineering, biostatistics and epidemiology utilizing risk-benefit analysis and randomized controlled trials that are supposed to deliver highly credible and trustworthy care to a patient. However, clinical research that is published and peer-reviewed, as demonstrated by the Covid vaccine trials is now the property of Big Pharma and under complete influence by them. If scientific research is going to be owned and manipulated by Big Pharma, the question becomes, why even do clinical trials of drugs?<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"></a></p>
